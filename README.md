# CodeTechIT-Task-2
This is a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks from a to-do list. The tasks are dynamically rendered as list items, and each item can be toggled between completed and active states. Users can also remove tasks they no longer need.
